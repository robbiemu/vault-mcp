# Wrap-Up Tasks Completion Summary

## Tasks Completed for Version 0.3.0 Release

### ✅ Task 2: Bump Project Version to 0.3.0

**Status**: Already Complete
- The `version` field in `pyproject.toml` was already updated to `"0.3.0"`
- This represents a minor version bump due to significant new features and backward-compatible functionality

### ✅ Task 3: Update README.md for Version 0.3.0

**Status**: Complete - All acceptance criteria met

#### 1. Version Number ✅
- Updated README.md header from "Version 0.2.3" to "Version 0.3.0"

#### 2. Features Section ✅
- Added **Flexible Ingestion** feature: "Supports standard Markdown folders, Obsidian vaults, and Joplin notebooks"
- Added **Configurable Post-Processing** feature: "Choose between agentic (AI-enhanced) or static (fast, deterministic) retrieval modes"
- Updated description to reflect multi-source document support
- Updated **Markdown Processing** to mention "Structure-aware parsing with LlamaIndex integration"

#### 3. Configuration Options ✅
- **New `paths.type` setting documented** with three valid options:
  - `"Standard"` - Plain Markdown folders
  - `"Obsidian"` - Obsidian vaults
  - `"Joplin"` - Joplin notebooks

- **New `[joplin_config]` section documented** with:
  - Explanation of `api_token` field
  - Step-by-step instructions for obtaining Joplin API token:
    1. Enable Joplin Web Clipper in Tools → Options → Web Clipper
    2. Copy authorization token from Web Clipper settings
    3. Add token to `app.toml` configuration

- **New `[retrieval]` section documented** with:
  - `mode` setting options (`"agentic"` vs `"static"`)
  - Clear examples for both modes
  - Explanation of when generation_model is required vs optional

#### 4. Architecture / How It Works ✅
- **Completely rewritten** to reflect the new two-stage pipeline:
  - Document Loading stage using multi-source readers (SimpleDirectoryReader, ObsidianReader, JoplinReader)
  - Node Parsing stage using LlamaIndex's MarkdownNodeParser
  - Removed references to old `DocumentProcessor`
  - Added explanation of configurable retrieval modes

- **Updated ingestion flow** to show modern LlamaIndex-based architecture
- **Preserved existing quality scoring and storage explanations**

## Key Improvements Made

### Enhanced Multi-Source Support
- Clear documentation for all three document source types
- Practical configuration examples for each source
- Step-by-step Joplin setup instructions

### Configurable Post-Processing Documentation
- Detailed explanation of agentic vs static modes
- Performance trade-offs clearly explained
- Configuration requirements for each mode

### Modern Architecture Description

- LlamaIndex integration highlighted
- Backwards compatibility maintained

## Validation

All configuration examples in the updated README have been tested and validated:
- Standard + Static mode configuration works
- Obsidian + Agentic mode configuration works
- Joplin configuration format is correct
- All TOML syntax is valid

## Release Readiness

Version 0.3.0 is now ready for release with:
- ✅ Updated version numbers
