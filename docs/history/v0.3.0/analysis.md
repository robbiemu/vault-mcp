# Analysis of Version v0.3.0 (Commit: `9c395af`)

This document analyzes the changes introduced in version `v0.3.0` of the Vault MCP server. This is a massive, feature-rich release that delivers on the architectural promises of the previous versions and significantly expands the application's capabilities.

## 1. State of the Project

The long-promised agentic RAG finally runs end-to-end. It introduces a completely new document processing pipeline, adds support for multiple document sources, and, most importantly, makes the RAG pipeline fully configurable and functional.

The key changes in this version are:
- Brand-new **ingestion pipeline**: multi-source loaders (Obsidian, Joplin, vanilla Markdown), structure-aware Markdown parsing, and a dedicated ChunkQualityScorer.
- Two *retrieval modes* in config.toml:
  - *agentic*: LLM rewrites each retrieved chunk for clarity and relevance (no longer a stub!)
  - *static*: fast, deterministic context expansion without any LLM calls.
- **Extensive Documentation:** The `README.md` and other documentation files have been overhauled to reflect the new features, architecture, and configuration options.

## 2. What it Was Doing Right

- **Delivering on the Vision:** This release finally brings the ambitious vision of the previous versions to life. The agentic RAG pipeline is now functional and the system is much more powerful.
- **Pragmatism and Flexibility:** The addition of the "static" mode is a brilliant, practical feature. It acknowledges that not all users need or want to use an LLM for every query and provides a fast and efficient alternative. This makes the application much more versatile.
- **Extensible and Robust Architecture:** The new document processing pipeline is a major improvement. It's more modular, more powerful, and makes it much easier to add support for new document sources in the future.
- **High-Quality Documentation:** The documentation is once again a strong point. The `README.md` is very clear and comprehensive, and new documentation files have been added to explain the new features in detail.

## 3. What it Was Doing Wrong (or Could Be Improved)

With the implementation of the agentic rewriting, the most significant remaining gap is the lack of a final answer synthesis step.
- **No Final Answer Generation:** Even in `agentic` mode, the `/mcp/query` endpoint returns a list of rewritten source chunks, but it does not synthesize them into a single, coherent answer. The user is still left to piece together the answer from the sources. This is now the main missing piece of a complete RAG pipeline.

## 4. What it Was Lacking

- **Answer Synthesis:** The final "G" in RAG (Generation) is still missing from the user-facing output. A module is needed to take the rewritten chunks and generate a final, synthesized answer to the user's query.
- **Full Implementation of MLX Embeddings:** The MLX embedding provider is still a fallback.

In summary, `v0.3.0` is a massive step forward. It's a feature-packed release that makes the project a truly powerful and flexible tool for interacting with local documents. The implementation of the agentic rewriting and the addition of the static mode are both huge wins. The project is now very close to being a complete, end-to-end RAG solution. The only major missing piece is the final answer generation step.
