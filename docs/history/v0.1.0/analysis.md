# Analysis of Version v0.1.0 (Commit: `cf035cd`)

This document provides an analysis of the initial version of the Vault MCP server, based on the state of the repository at commit `cf035cd`, which corresponds to version `0.1.0`.

## 1. State of the Project

The initial version of the project is a functional, albeit basic, semantic search server for Obsidian vaults. It is named "Vault MCP" and is designed to be compliant with a "Model Context Protocol (MCP)".

The core functionalities at this stage are:
- **Indexing:** It can scan a directory of Markdown files (`.md`), process them, and index them in a vector store.
- **Semantic Search:** It provides an API endpoint to perform semantic search over the indexed documents.
- **Live Synchronization:** It includes a file watcher that monitors the vault for changes and automatically updates the index.
- **Quality Filtering:** It implements a heuristic-based quality scoring for document chunks and uses it to filter and rank search results.
- **API Server:** It exposes a RESTful API built with FastAPI, with endpoints for search, document retrieval, and server info.

The project is built on a modern Python stack, including:
- **FastAPI** for the web server.
- **ChromaDB** as the vector store.
- **Sentence-Transformers** for generating embeddings.
- **`uv`** for package management.
- **`mistune`** for Markdown parsing.

The project structure is well-organized from the beginning, with a clear separation of concerns into `components` (server, vector store, file watcher) and a `vault_mcp` directory for shared utilities.

## 2. What it Was Doing Right

- **Solid Foundation:** The initial commit establishes a very strong and well-architected foundation for the project. The component-based architecture is a great choice for modularity and future expansion.
- **Excellent Documentation:** The `README.md` is exceptionally comprehensive for an initial commit. It clearly explains the project's purpose, features, architecture, setup, and API.
- **Modern Tooling:** The choice of modern and effective tools like FastAPI, ChromaDB, and `uv` shows a commitment to good development practices.
- **Clear Vision:** The presence of `config/prompts.toml` and `config/templates.yaml` (in this version), even if unused, indicates that the developer had a clear and ambitious vision for the project's future.

## 3. What it Was Doing Wrong (or Could Be Improved)

- **Simplistic RAG Implementation:** What’s missing is the “G” in RAG: the /mcp/query endpoint simply returns the best chunk verbatim—no LLM synthesis yet.


## 4. What it Was Lacking

- **True Answer Generation:** The most significant missing piece is a proper answer generation module that uses an LLM to synthesize a comprehensive answer from the retrieved chunks.
- **Advanced Features from Config Files:** The features described in `config/prompts.toml` and `config/templates.yaml` are completely absent from the implementation.
- **Scalability:** The `README.md` mentions that the project is optimized for small vaults, indicating that scalability was a known limitation.

In summary, `v0.1.0` is an excellent starting point. It's a functional application with a solid architecture and clear documentation. It successfully implements the core logic of a semantic search server, while clearly laying the groundwork for more advanced features to come.
