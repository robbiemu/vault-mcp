# Agentic Retriever Component

This document describes the `Agentic Retriever` component, which is responsible for orchestrating the core agentic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) functionality within the vault-mcp server. It leverages LlamaIndex and agent-driven processes to manage search, chunk refinement, and generation tasks.

## Purpose

The `Agentic Retriever` is designed to:

- Perform targeted document searches using the `DocumentRAGTool`.
- Refine document chunks to enhance relevance using agents.
- Process and construct comprehensive responses using `ChunkRewriteAgent` and `ChunkRewriterPostprocessor`.

## Architecture

### Key Classes

- **DocumentRAGTool**: Aids in conducting targeted searches within individual documents by employing vector store indices.

- **ChunkRewriteAgent**: Manages the rewriting of document chunks by leveraging contextual information and available tools to improve relevance.

- **ChunkRewriterPostprocessor**: Coordinates concurrent chunk rewriting operations using agents, maintaining response quality and efficiency.

- **create_agentic_query_engine**: Factory function that integrates embedding models, setups LLM configurations, initiates vector stores, and configures the query engine to deliver comprehensive agentic RAG features.

## "Retrieve-and-Refine" Workflow

The component employs a multi-stage process:

1. **Search Initiation**: Begins with search requests directed to specific documents using `DocumentRAGTool`.

2. **Context Establishment**: Collects multiple context-chunks relevant to the query for further processing.

3. **Contextual Refinement**: Utilizes `ChunkRewriteAgent` to refine individual chunks, ensuring alignment with the query and contextual information.

4. **Post-processing**: Enlists `ChunkRewriterPostprocessor` to coordinate concurrent chunk processing, resulting in improved response precision.

5. **Comprehensive Answer**: Provides a complete and refined response, generated using agent-driven rewriting techniques.

## Usage

The `Agentic Retriever` is pivotal to server operations, providing the primary retrieval and refinement capabilities leveraged by the REST API endpoints. It integrates seamlessly within the FastAPI lifecycle, ensuring efficient search and generation functionality.

## Conclusion

The `Agentic Retriever` component embodies the core intelligence of the vault-mcp server, offering sophisticated RAG features. Its design enables seamless integration with other system components, maintaining code modularity, readability, and extensibility.
